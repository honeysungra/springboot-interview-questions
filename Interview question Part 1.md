# Spring Boot Interview Question


#### Q1. What is Spring Boot and mention the need for it?

Answer:- Spring boot is an open source spring module that aims to simplify the use of the Spring framework. It is used to create standalone Spring-based applications with minimal setup and configuration that you can just run.
It basically removes a lot of configurations and dependencies, allowing developers to focus more on writing the application logic rather than dealing with infrastructure setup.

#### Q2. What is the need for spring boot application?

Answer:-  The need for Spring Boot arises from the complexity involved in setting up a Spring application. 
Traditionally, developers had to configure various components such as data sources, application servers, and logging frameworks manually, which could be time-consuming and error-prone.
Spring Boot streamlines this process by providing defaults for these configurations, making it easier to get started with Spring-based projects. 
It also offers a range of features such as embedded servers, auto-configuration, and starter dependencies, which further simplify and accelerate the development process.

#### Q3. Key features of Spring boot.

Answer:- Few important features of Spring Boot are as follows:

#### 1.  Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on its dependencies, reducing the need for manual configuration.

#### 2. Spring Boot CLI - The Spring Boot Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to quickly create, test, and run Spring Boot applications using a command-line interface.

#### 3. Starter dependencies -  Spring Boot offers a set of "starter" dependencies that simplify the inclusion of libraries for common tasks such as web development, data access, and security and eventually improves productivity.

#### 4. Spring Initializer - This is basically a web application, which can create an internal project structure for you. So, you do not have to manually set up the structure of the project, instead, you can use this feature.

#### 5. Spring Actuator - Spring Boot Actuator provides a set of production-ready features to help you monitor and manage your application, including health checks, metrics, and more.

#### 6. Logging and Security â€“ The logging and security feature of Spring Boot, ensures that all the applications made using Spring Boot are properly secured without any hassle.

#### 7. Spring Boot DevTools: DevTools provides development-time features like automatic restarts, LiveReload support, and remote debugging to enhance the developer experience.

#### 8. Embedded servlet container support: Spring Boot provides out-of-the-box support for embedded servlet containers like Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, making it easy to run web applications.
